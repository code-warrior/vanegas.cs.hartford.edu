    <h1>Advising Instructions</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Hello, advisees,</p>

    <p>Welcome to the <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Computer Science">cs</abbr></span> Dept! I will elaborate below on how our advisor-advisee relationship will work for the duration of your time with me as your advisor. Please <strong>read everything on this page carefully and repeatedly</strong>, then <em>bookmark this page</em>.</p>

    <p>My role as your advisor is <em>not</em> to tell you what to do, but rather, to ensure the choices you make with regard to courses keep you on the path to graduation. I advise you on what might be a better plan of academic action, should I see a flaw in your choice of courses.</p>

    <p>As the advisee, it’s <em>your</em> duty to research <em>thoroughly</em> what is required to earn your degree. Because a mistake in this process is costly, in terms of time and money, it’s critical that you research <em>diligently</em> the requirements for your degree. Together, our joint effort ensures your success in graduating.</p>

    <p>We will usually meet twice per year for advising: once in the middle of the spring semester for fall classes, once in the middle of the fall semester for spring classes.</p>

    <h2>Before Advising</h2>

    <p>Outlined below are the steps you’ll need to carry out <em>every</em> semester <em>before</em> our official advising sessions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Understand the requirements for your degree</strong>. It is imperative that you understand the courses required to graduate: which courses are required, which are electives. You will also need to familiarize — or re-familiarize — yourself with the University’s general education requirements, or gen eds. Links are provided below, under the <b>Links</b> section, to help you understand courses for the major, electives, and the gen ed requirements.</li>

      <li><strong>Perform your own degree audit</strong>. Log in to <a href="https://dw-java-prod-01.hartford.edu/ResponsiveDashboard/login.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DegreeWorks</a> or <a href="https://uhart-pssba-001.hartford.edu:8910/PROD/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Self Service</a> (<code>Student → Academic Records → Degree Works</code>) and perform your own course audit. (The DegreeWorks link may not work, but the Self Service should.) Carefully inspect <em>every</em> aspect of the audit, looking for errors and verifying the entries with what you need for gen ed, elective, and major requirements, as discussed in step 1. <strong>Print a copy of your audit and annotate it neatly in this and the subsequent steps below.</strong></li>

      <li><strong>Identify the gen ed and major courses offered in the coming semester</strong>. Acquire a clear understanding of the courses you need by visiting the <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/about/offices-divisions/office-registrar/registration/schedule-classes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schedule of Classes</a>. Every course you select for registration <em>must</em> fulfill a requirement for a gen ed, your major, your minor, or an elective. The gen ed portion is divided into <b>First-Year Seminar</b>, <b>Foundations of Citizenship</b>, <b>Exploration and Breadth</b>, <b>Foundational Competencies</b>, and <b>University Requirements</b>. (All of this is explained under the <b>General</b> link below.) The other categories relate to your major(s) and/or minor(s).</li>

      <li><strong>Create at least two schedules</strong>. Identify <em>multiple</em> courses in your class search in the event of an unanticipated problem that won’t allow you to register for your original choices. Create <em>at least</em> <strong>two</strong> schedules for the upcoming semester registration.</li>

      <li><strong>Forward your audit to me.</strong> Leave your neat and organized annotated audit in Dana Hall 220 with our office co-ordinator, or drop it off in person during my office hours. <strong>If your audit is unclear, messy, illegible, or sloppy, I will ask you to redo it.</strong> I’ll acknowledge receipt of your audit via email.</li>

      <li><strong>Make an appointment with me</strong>. Prepare answers to the following questions about your choice of courses: How many credits is each course worth? Which category does each course fulfill? How many credits is left in the category your course choice fulfils? And, how many credits are you enrolling in for the next semester? Once you’re prepared to answer all the aforementioned questions, make an appointment to meet with me. <strong><em>Do not make an advising appointment if you’re not prepared to answer these questions</em></strong>. At the conclusion of our advising session, I will provide you with your registration <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Personal Identification Number">pin</abbr></span>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: I’m not a financial aid counselor; I <em>don’t</em> advise on matters related to <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/admission/financial-aid/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial aid</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Issues regarding the pass/no pass option <em>must</em> be discussed with the course’s instructor. My role as your advisor is to sign any documentation requiring an advisor’s signature. You can read about the process on the University’s <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/academics/schools-colleges/enhp/academics/office-of-academic-services.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Academic Resources page</a>.</p>
