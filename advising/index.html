    <h1>Advising Instructions</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Hello, advisees,</p>

    <p>Welcome to the <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Computer Science">cs</abbr></span> Dept! I will elaborate below on how our advisor-advisee relationship will work for the duration of your time with me as your advisor. Please <strong>read everything on this page carefully and repeatedly</strong>, then <em>bookmark this page</em>.</p>

    <p>My role as your advisor is <em>not</em> to tell you what to do, but rather, to ensure the choices you make with regard to courses keep you on the path to graduation. I advise you on what might be a better plan of academic action, should I see a flaw in your choice of courses.</p>

    <p>As the advisee, it’s <em>your</em> duty to research <em>thoroughly</em> what is required to earn your degree. Because a mistake in this process is costly, in terms of time and money, it’s critical that you research <em>diligently</em> the requirements for your degree. Together, our joint effort ensures your success in graduating.</p>

    <p>We will usually meet twice per year for advising: once in the middle of the spring semester for fall classes, once in the middle of the fall semester for spring classes.</p>

    <h2>Before Advising</h2>

    <p>Outlined below are the steps you’ll need to carry out <em>every</em> semester <em>before</em> our official advising sessions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>It is imperative that you understand the program</strong>: which courses are required, which are electives. You will also need to familiarize — or re-familiarize — yourself with the University’s general education requirements, or gen eds. Links are provided below to help you understand courses for the major, electives, and the gen ed requirements.</li>

      <li><strong>Request a degree audit from The Center for Student Success, or <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Center for Student Success">css</abbr></span></strong>. As of spring 2021, our <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Center for Student Success">css</abbr></span> contact is Ryan Allen. Once he gets back to you with your audit, verify that all the info in the audit is correct, then verify the entries with what you need for gen ed, elective, and major requirements, as discussed in step 1.</li>

      <li><strong>With a clear understanding of the courses you’ve taken, identify the gen ed and major courses offered in the coming semester </strong> by visiting the <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/about/offices-divisions/office-registrar/registration/schedule-classes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schedule of Classes</a>. Additionally, identify <em>multiple</em> courses in your class search in the event of an unanticipated problem that won’t allow you to register for your original choices. Create <em>at least</em> two schedules.</li>

      <li><strong>Forward the audit to me via email</strong>, once you’ve verified all the entries in it. I can’t advise you until I’ve had time to study your audit.</li>

      <li><strong>Once you’ve carried out steps 1–4, make an appointment with me so we can verify your choices</strong>. I will then provide you with your registration <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Personal Identification Number">pin</abbr></span>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: I’m not a financial aid counselor; I <em>don’t</em> advise on matters related to <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/admission/financial-aid/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial aid</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Issues regarding the pass/no pass option <em>must</em> be discussed with the course’s instructor. My role as your advisor is to sign any documentation requiring an advisor’s signature. You can read about the process on the University’s <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/academics/schools-colleges/enhp/academics/office-of-academic-services.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Academic Resources page</a>.</p>
