    <h1>Advising Instructions</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Hello, advisees,</p>

    <p>Welcome to the <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Computer Science">cs</abbr></span> Dept! I will elaborate below on how our advisor-advisee relationship will work for the duration of your time with me as your advisor. <strong>Read everything on this page carefully and repeatedly</strong>, then <em>bookmark it</em>.</p>

    <p>My role as your advisor is <em>not</em> to tell you what to do, but rather, to ensure the choices you make with regard to courses keep you on the path to graduation. I advise you on what might be a better plan of academic action, should I see a flaw in your choice of courses.</p>

    <p>As the advisee, it’s <em>your</em> duty to research <em>thoroughly</em> what is required to earn your degree. Because a mistake in this process is costly, in terms of time and money, it’s critical that you research <em>diligently</em> the requirements for your degree. Together, our joint effort ensures your success in graduating.</p>

    <p>We will usually meet twice per year for advising: once in the middle of the spring semester for fall classes, once in the middle of the fall semester for spring classes.</p>

    <h2 id="before-advising">Before Advising</h2>

    <p>Outlined below are the steps you’ll need to carry out <em>every</em> semester <em>before</em> our official advising sessions. The advising period is a busy time every semester, and much more so in the spring. If you wait until the last minute, you’ll end up waiting days, or even weeks, for an advising appointment; if you wait until the semester starts, then it’ll be too late. <strong>Note</strong>: A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Understand the requirements for your degree</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px">It is imperative that you understand the course requisites to graduate. To do so, you’ll need to study carefully the courses required for the major, including co- and pre-requisites; the electives in the major, and minor, if applicable; and, the general education requirements, including electives. Links are provided under the <b>Links</b> section below to help you understand this protocol.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Perform your own degree audit</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px">Log in to <a href="https://dw-java-prod-01.hartford.edu/ResponsiveDashboard/login.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DegreeWorks <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> or <a href="https://uhart-pssba-001.hartford.edu:8910/PROD/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Self Service <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (<code>Student → Academic Records → Degree Works</code>) and retrieve your own course audit, which looks like <a href="http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/pdfs/sample-degree-audit.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. Carefully inspect <em>every</em> aspect of the audit, looking for errors and verifying the entries with what you need for gen ed, elective, and major requirements, as discussed in step 1. Also, ensure that your initial matriculation date, which appears on your audit as “Catalog year” under <b>Bachelor of Arts Requirements</b>, is correct.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: I have seen many errors in student audits. <strong>Any course-related errors that pertain to The Dept of Computing Sciences should be brought to my attention during our advising session. All other errors must be brought to the attention of <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Center for Student Success">css</abbr></span></strong>, who are responsible for fixing non-departmental audit errors. Have any issues resolved in the semester in which you discover them.</p>
        <p>Once everything is verified and correct, <em>print a copy of your audit in preparation for the next steps</em>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3 id="identify-courses-offered-in-the-coming-semester">Identify the courses offered in the coming semester</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px">Search for the classes offered next semester. (See the next paragraph for useful, course search-related links.) Every course you select for registration <em>must</em> fulfill a requirement for a gen ed, your major, your minor, or an elective. The gen ed portion is divided into <b>First-Year Seminar</b>, <b>Foundations of Citizenship</b>, <b>Exploration and Breadth</b>, <b>Foundational Competencies</b>, and <b>University Requirements</b>. (All of this is explained under the <b>General</b> link below.) The other categories relate to your major(s) and/or minor(s).</p>
        <p>For a general search of all courses, click <a href="https://uhart-pssba-001.hartford.edu/PROD/bzskfcls.P_CrseSearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. For courses more specific to your discipline, follow the links below, which you can bookmark for further reference or whose link you can copy from your browser’s address bar — none of which can be done from the course search page natively.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Create at least two schedules</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px">Identify <em>multiple</em> courses in your class search in the event of an unanticipated problem that won’t allow you to register for your original choices. Create <em>at least</em> <strong>two</strong> schedules for the upcoming semester registration.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Annotate your audit</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px">The audit you printed in step 2 needs to be annotated with a cross-listing of the courses you choose to enroll in (from The University’s course search) with the courses you need to graduate (from your audit). Highlight the courses you’ve chosen, making — at the very least — a comment about the semester in which you plan to take the course.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Bring your audit to me</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px">Make a copy of your neat and organized, annotated audit. Keep the original. Bring the copy to me during office hours in Dana Hall 310, or slip it under the door. <strong>Do not email a copy; only hardcopies are accepted</strong>. <strong>If your audit is unclear, messy, illegible, or sloppy, I will ask you to redo it.</strong> I’ll acknowledge receipt of your audit via email.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Make an appointment with me</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px">Prepare answers to the following questions about your choice of courses:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How many credits is each course worth?</li>
          <li>Which category does each course fulfill?</li>
          <li>How many credits are left in the category your course choice fulfils?</li>
          <li>How many credits are you enrolling in for the next semester?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you’re prepared to answer all the aforementioned questions, make an appointment to meet with me two business days <em>after</em> providing me with your audit. <strong><em>Do not make an advising appointment if you’re not prepared to answer these questions</em></strong>. At the conclusion of our advising session, I will provide you with your registration <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="Personal Identification Number">pin</abbr></span>.</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>I don’t send or receive email attachments to advisees.</strong> Instead, I share a Microsoft OneDrive folder with you and grant you edit access. Any documents we need to share with each other <em>must</em> be placed in this folder.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: I’m not a financial aid counselor; I <em>don’t</em> advise on matters related to <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/admission/financial-aid/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial aid <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Issues regarding the pass/no pass option <em>must</em> be discussed with the course’s instructor. My role as your advisor is to sign any documentation requiring an advisor’s signature. You can read about the process on the University’s <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/academics/schools-colleges/enhp/academics/office-of-academic-services.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Academic Resources page <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>

    <h2 id="registration-schedule">Fall 2024 Registration Schedule</h2>
    <p>Your registration date is determined by the number of credits you have earned to date. This does not include the credits for which you are currently registered. If you have no earned credits, your date is determined by your last name. You may not register before your assigned date, but any time after is fine.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 36px;">Online registration will be available through the first week of classes in the fall.</p>

    <!-- **************************************************************************************************************
      FAQs
     *************************************************************************************************************** -->
    <h2 id="faqs"><abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr>s</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>How many credits define full-time student status?</dt>
      <dd>A 12-credit load is considered full-time; enrolling in more than 18 is considered an overload that requires approval.</dd>
      <dt>The class I was looking to register in is full. What can my advisor do for me?</dt>
      <dd>Nothing, I’m afraid. You’ll need to contact the instructor of the course to discuss options, including over-rides.</dd>
      <dt>The <abbr class="small-caps" title="Learning Beyond the Classroom">lbc</abbr>, or Learning Beyond the Classroom, requirement is confusing. What is the definitive explanation of how it works?</dt>
      <dd>The University has compiled a <a href="https://www.hartford.edu/academics/schools-colleges/arts-sciences/academics/academic-services/learning-beyond-classroom/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed page explaining it</a>. Ensure you read it all, as it pertains to your degree.</dd>
      <dt>How late may I add a class to my schedule?</dt>
      <dd>You can technically add a class anytime before the drop period, which is usually week 10 of the semester. The longer a student waits to register for a class, the more difficult it is to get approved. The breakdown is simple:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Week 1</b>: No approval is needed.</li>
          <li><b>Week 2</b>: Approval and a signature is needed from the instructor of the class(es) in which you’d like to register. You will need the registration add/drop form.</li>
          <li><b>Week 3</b>: Approval and a signature is needed from the instructor of the class(es) in which you’d like to register, and the same is needed from the dean. This is the most difficult stage in which to get approval, because it is so late in the semester. A <abbr class="small-caps" title="Personal Identification Number">pin</abbr> is no longer needed at this stage. You will need the registration add/drop form.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Note</strong>: Always ask the course instructor <em>before</em> filling out the registration add/drop form, as the instructor may not let you in. You’ll want to know this information <em>before</em> filling out any paperwork.
      </dd>

      <dt>Would I be able to take a <em>gen ed</em> course as pass/fail?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. If you desire to make this change <em>before</em> the official drop date, typically around week 10 of the semester, then all you need to do is fill out a Registration/Add/Drop Form that I’d share with you in our shared folder.</dd>

      <dt>Would I be able to take an <em>elective</em> course as pass/fail?</dt>
      <dd>You may take any <abbr class="small-caps" title="Computer Science">cs</abbr> elective pass/fail but, it will not count towards your degree. If you receive a “P”, you will receive the credits earned, but it cannot be used toward an upper-level <abbr class="small-caps" title="Computer Science">cs</abbr> elective. You can choose to re-take it in the future for a grade.</dd>

      <dt>Would I be able to take a <em>required</em> course as pass/fail?</dt>
      <dd>Required courses <em>must</em> be taken with the letter grade option for them to apply towards your degree. (This restriction was temporarily relaxed in 2020 to ease the burden of CoViD-19 on students.) You may, however, take a required <abbr class="small-caps" title="Computer Science">cs</abbr> course pass/fail but, for the course to apply to your degree, it will <em>have</em> to be taken at some point with the letter grade option.</dd>

      <dt>Can you, as my advisor, over-ride me into someone else’s class?</dt>
      <dd>No. Only the instructor of the class you wish to take can over-ride the system to let you in.</dd>

      <dt>Am I bound to the major requirements in place on the day I initially enrolled at The University, or to the requirements in place on the day I declared my major?</dt>
      <dd>By default, every student is bound to the bulletin year in which they were admitted, not when they transfer majors — or declare one — within The University. However, it’s possible for a student to choose a <em>newer</em> group of requirements. An <a href="http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/pdfs/adjustment-of-degree-requirements.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adjustment of Degree Requirements <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> form is required to be filed with the student’s, their advisor’s, the chair’s, and the dean’s signatures.</dd>

      <dt>May I take a class at another institution as a substitute for an equivalent course at <span class="small-caps">uh</span>art?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Yes. The process, however, is involved. The general 5 steps are discussed below. Your exact situation may differ.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>You’ll need a copy of the syllabus for the course you’d like to take at the external institution. In some cases, a course description may suffice, but a syllabus is clearer in terms of what the course covers. Submit the syllabus to the chair of the department at <span class="small-caps">uh</span>art that offers the same class. He/she/they will verify/approve that the course is equivalent to the course that conflicts at <span class="small-caps">uh</span>art. If the course you need to take at the external institution is the result of a conflict with another course you’re taking at <span class="small-caps">uh</span>art, then you’ll need to prove the conflict by providing a schedule.</p></li>
          <li><p>With the approval in place, you’ll then need to fill out the <a href="http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/pdfs/permit-for-transfer-credits.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Permit for Transfer Credits <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> form using Adobe Acrobat, which further elaborates on the transfer procedure. <strong>Read it carefully.</strong></p></li>
          <li><p>You’ll then need to have a college evaluator at <span class="small-caps">uh</span>art sign the document. (Contact the Office of Admissions to locate your college evaluator.)</p></li>
          <li><p>Take the form from step 2 to the Office of Admission and <strong>request a copy of the form for your records</strong>.</p></li>
          <li><p>Once the course is completed, request that an official transcript be sent from the external institution to <span class="small-caps">uh</span>art. <strong>Do this <em>immediately</em> after finishing the semester.</strong> Again, refer to the form in step 2 for physical and email addresses you will need to complete this process.</p></li>
